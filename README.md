## Notes

I keep the same note 

The most challenging thing I faced is my Bitchy 'Mom'. She is not my real mom but act like my mom with much more bitchy. The crazy girl and she doesn't treat me well. I hate her 

She travelled to HK and leave me alone
She backed without any present for me. Ugly and selfish
